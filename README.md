# P5 Typescript Webpack Starter

## Purpose
I created this project from a desire to create P5 sketches in Typescript. I also wanted to be able to using modules and have the benefits of Webpack.

## Execution
1. ``` npm start ```
1. F5 to start the debugger in Chrome

## Creation

This project was created with the following commands:

```
mkdir P5Typescript

cd P5Typescript

npm init -y

npm install p5 --save

npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server clean-webpack-plugin typescript ts-loader html-webpack-plugin @types/p5 css-loader style-loader node-sass sass-loader papaparse --save-dev
```
